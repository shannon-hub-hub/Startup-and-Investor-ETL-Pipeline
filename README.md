# Startup & Investor ETL Pipeline
Python ETL pipeline that scrapes, cleans, validates, and stores startup and investor data from public websites. Uses Selenium to extract from tables and cards, normalizes fields like funding stage, countries, and check size, and generates automated data quality reports. Saves data to CSV and SQLite for analysis.
Key Points:
* End-to-end ETL: Extract → Transform → Load
* Cleans and standardizes messy web data
* Automated data quality checks and reports
* Output: CSV and SQLite
Tech: Python, Selenium, SQLite, CSV/JSON
